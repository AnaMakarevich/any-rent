# AnyRent: Peer-to-peer rental and shared ownership service

## Inspiration
A lot of effort has been made to reduce the carbon footprint. We are trying to buy local, we're trying to go green, to prefer reusable packaging and so on. However, the major problem that why it is so hard to achieve is that we are just consuming too much without thinking. We buy because we can. And sometimes we buy things that they we don't even use in the end or use rarely. These things reside in the attic collecting dust, while companies are using more and more resources to create new items. Why not just rent out these things when you don't need them? And get them back when you need it again? In a secure way. For example, a bit travel suitcase - you rarely need it, but you still have to find storage for it! So we came up with the idea to organiser peer-to-peer rental and ownership serivce, that helps people to rent from each other or organise a co-ownership.


## What it does

Imagine, there is a girl called Lily. She is 24 and she is all excitied about skateboarding, so she goes and buys a new skateboard for her to start with the new hobby. A few months later Lily finds a job in a big corporation, and she gets so busy with her new responsibilities that she doesn't have time for her hobby anymore. And the skateboard is taking space. She still wants to own it because she thinks he might get back to her hobby at some point. Lily uses AnyRent to offer her skateboard to people nearby for a while, while being secured by the contract that she will get it back in a good condition.

Next, there is Steven, 18, who is not sure he will like skateboarding, but wants to try it for a couple of months. Steven uses AnyRent to rent a skateboard for a few weeks and then return it, knowing if he wants one forever or if he will be just renting it from time to time. 

And finally there is Amy and Mark who live on the same street. They don't know each other, but they both like creating music from time to time. Buying a full new equipment alone is expensive and they will have to save for a long time. They use AnyApp to search for a potential co-owner and find each other. They they request and confirm co-ownership of the item using the app, that tracks and verifies fair usage schedule.
